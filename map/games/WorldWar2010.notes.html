<br> The year is 2010.
<br>
<br> The nations of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) have moved their troops towards the borders with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
<br>
<br> A minor conflict between their respective allies, the Peace and Security Council (PSC) of the African Union and the Union of South American Nations (USAN), will set the world on fire...

<br> About this map:<ul>
<li> This map is based on the WW2V3 ruleset and units.
<li> The alliance organizations in this map, are actual alliances.
<li> The production-value per territory is based on the actual GDP, the availability of natural resources and the size and growth of their populations. (Source: the CIA World Factbook, 2009).
<li> The starting units are based on the actual military strength of each territory. (Source: - ok, sorry - Wikipedia).
<li> Neutral territories are powerful, yet interesting to conquer due to their strategic positions and/or production-values.
</ul>

<br> Strategy:<ul>
<li> SCO-PSC. At the start of the game, you have a total production-value of 19, but a production-capacity of only 3 units. Invest in at least one additional factory. Protect your west-coast from amfibious NATO assaults.
<li> SCO-CIS. Focus on the defence against, or the invasion of Europe. Prevent NATO from occupying the rich Middle-East. Try to occupy the Middle-East yourself. 
<li> SCO-China. Move your troops towards the neutral South-East Asia and India for additional production-value. Send troops to CIS to support them in their defence against NATO. Build a fleet to rule the Pacific and pose a direct threat to the Americas.
<li> NATO-USAN. Your corner of the world is pretty safe, so you can focus your limited means on attacking. The west-coast of Africa is an obvious choice for military expansion.
<li> NATO-Europe. Move troops towards the Middle-East to obtain the much needed resources. Build up a formidable force to overrun the CIS on your way to China.
<li> NATO-America. Through your base in the United Kingdom, support NATO-Europe in its defence againts CIS. Maintain your powerful fleet in order to reign the pacific. Conquer a high-value territory in Asia to take the battle to China's front-door.

Version history:<ul>
<li> 1.0.0: first public release.
<li> 1.0.1: territory names aligned, aaGun for Brazil, Low Luck by default off, connection Sea Zones 35 - 38 fixed.
<li> 1.1.0: Victory Cities added, incl. victory conditions Total Victory (18 cities), Honorable Surrender (15 cities, default), Projection of Power (13 cities).
New unit "helicopter" (movement 2, attack 4, defence 4) added. Strategic bombing now affects unit production. Unit images updated.
Bug fixes: empty neutral territories can be occupied, shipyards work correctly.
Balancing: 1) Production value of CIS one up with two territories of 2 PUs - for new factories - and Central Russia down from 5 to 4 PUs.
2) Redistributed units in South-East Asia to make the march from China to India more difficult.
3) India from 19 PUs to 15 PUs production value, for gaming balance in the long run. The Indian territories are now unfortunately no longer accurately valued.
4) Neutral units in the Pacific redistributed to make some territories easier Korea, Taiwan) and others more difficult to conquer (mainly Japan).
5) Fleet of China strengthened by replacing a destroyer by a battleship.
6) Fleet of Thailand-Vietnam moved from Sea Zone 36 (east side) to Sea Zone 37 (south-west side).
7) Fleet of Europe strengthened by three additional units, in accordance with the actual fleet strength. This also prevents Germany from being conquered bij CIS in the first round.
8) Two units from Greece stationed in Germany.
9) PSC territories: one PU taken from Ethiopia (from 2 to 1) and added to captitol Egypt-Sudan (from 3 to 4).
<li> 1.1.1: changes implemented to make the Ernie Bommel list of quality mods. Made compliant to technical standards (no impact on gameplay). Helicopters now defend with 3 in stead of 4.
The option of bidding added. Technology activation now takes place at the end of the turn. LHTR bombers are now editable. Also: color schemes adjusted, helicopter image updated (still not perfect though).
<li> 1.2.0: frontier between Sea Zones 5 and 6 adjusted - two units re-stationed from Germany to Greece (CIS fleet can no longer reach Germany directly in first round).
Carriers replace the battleship as leading capital ship (battleships are obsolete since 2006), making the carriers two-hit and cost 18 in stead of 14.
Relief tiles added (better looking map). Updated images: helicopters, AA radars, a hit factory and a hit carrier (new image).
<li> 1.3.0: APC's (armoured personnel carriers) added. Sub attack capability increased from 2 to 3; sub cost increased from 6 to 8. Carrier defence capability decreased from 2 to 1. Carriers by default no longer auto-repair - this feature is still available in the Game Options. Changes in unit numbers, in order to 1) add the APC's 2) remove the carrier from the Chinese fleet (this was very inaccurate) and 3) to re-balance the game. Connection between Central United States and 10 Sea Zone fixed. New helicopter images. Updated relief tiles.
